By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.
  
- This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.wiki/w/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following:
  - Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone.
- On servers where chat signing is optional, the modpack opts out of it for the playing user to adhere to server's intent. An indicator icon is added to inform players of the signing status in the server (whether the server supports Mojang's chat safety features).
  
- The modpack disables Mojang's analytics collection, individual mod update checkers and cosmetic donor features, plus any other network services that may invade privacy or cause confusion. **All of these can be re-enabled by users in the respective configs.**
